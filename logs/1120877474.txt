Context: The Medical Termination of Pregnancy (Amendment) Act, 2021, does recognize and emphasize the agency of the woman seeking abortion. The amendment aims to give women greater autonomy and control over their reproductive choices. Here's how the act acknowledges the agency of the woman seeking abortion: 1. Increased Gestation Limit: By extending the gestation limit for abortions from 20 weeks to 24 weeks, the amendment allows women more time to make an informed decision about their pregnancy. This acknowledges that women may need additional time to consider their options and exercise their agency in deciding whether to continue or terminate the pregnancy 2. Special Provisions for Certain Women: The amendment includes provisions for vulnerable women, such as survivors of rape, victims of incest, and differently-abled women. These women can seek termination of pregnancy beyond 24 weeks, subject to the opinion of a registered medical practitioner. This recognizes the unique situations these women may be facing and respects their agency in making reproductive choices 3. Privacy and Confidentiality: The amendment emphasizes the importance of maintaining the privacy and confidentiality of women seeking termination of pregnancy. This is to protect the woman's agency and ensure that her decision is respected and kept confidential 4. Expanded Role of Registered Medical Practitioners: The amendment allows registered medical practitioners to perform medical termination of pregnancies. By involving a broader range of medical professionals, the amendment acknowledges that women should have the agency to seek safe and legal abortion services from various medical practitioners Overall, the Medical Termination of Pregnancy (Amendment) Act, 2021, aims to empower women and recognize their agency in making decisions related to their reproductive health.
