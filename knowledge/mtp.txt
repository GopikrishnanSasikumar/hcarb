Increased Gestation Limit: By extending the gestation limit for abortions from 20 weeks to 24 weeks, the amendment allows women more time to make an informed decision about their pregnancy.

Special Provisions for Certain Women: The amendment includes provisions for vulnerable women, such as survivors of rape, victims of incest, and differently-abled women.

Privacy and Confidentiality: The amendment emphasizes the importance of maintaining the privacy and confidentiality of women seeking termination of pregnancy. This is to protect the woman's agency and ensure that her decision is respected and kept confidential 4. Expanded Role of Registered Medical Practitioners: The amendment allows registered medical practitioners to perform medical termination of pregnancies. By involving a broader range of medical professionals, the amendment acknowledges that women should have the agency to seek safe and legal abortion services from various medical practitioners Overall, the Medical Termination of Pregnancy (Amendment) Act, 2021, aims to empower women and recognize their agency in making decisions related to their reproductive health.
